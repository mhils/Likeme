## Enhancing the Facebook Like-Experience. 
- Prevent **ClickJacking** with "I'd like to confirm."
- Stop Facebook **Tracking** with "I Like Privacy."

###I'd like to confirm
Displays a confirm dialog if you're clicking on a Facebook Like Button. 

This is useful against unintentional Likes (ClickJacking / LikeJacking). In addition, this extension emulates a Like Button Press and makes the current page believe that you liked it (although you didn't).

###I Like Privacy
Replaces Facebook Likebuttons with a local copy. Hinders Facebook keeping track of you. Click the copy to load the original (functional) one.
